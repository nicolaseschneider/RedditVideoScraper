TeamBombSquad-7581 points-9,TeamBombSquad,7581 points,"Any Simpsons episode from seasons 3-9.Edit: first and foremost, thank you for the awards!Secondly, it seems everyone has a lot of opinions about this spectacular show and what seasons are to be watched.IMHO, those seasons (to me) are the ones that I will still watch to this day and almost 30 years later I will still laugh until my sides hurt. Season 2, as many of you have pointed out, has some great episodes, but those are more feel-good moments with humor thrown in. Seasons 3-9 are what I watch if I am depressed and need to laugh.As for the person that said all of those seasons suck, I quote Homer after Moe says he feels Homer is taking unfair advantage of his generous offer of free peanuts: shut up!"

It used to be what i watched in the background while playing video games that didnt exactly require 100% attention all the time. If somebody mentions any part of an episode I can probably explain the plot of the rest of that episode tbh"
